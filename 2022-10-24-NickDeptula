Throughout the history of Alexandria, Egypt there have been various different types of murders many of which have gone unreported or unsolved. One murder in particular that stood out to me was Dr. Ververopoulo's murder. In the issue of "The Egyptian Gazette," it states Dr. Ververopoulo was murdered and was buried shortly after examination. There was no further explanation. Subsequently, after more research into who this Dr. Ververopoulo was, there was nothing else reported on the murder. This is just one of the many murders in ALexandria Egypt that have gone on reported without details or any further information.

As I continued to read the Egyptian Gazette, I started to notice this trend more and more. As the year continues we will continue to explore more of these underreported murders and dig deeper into them.
